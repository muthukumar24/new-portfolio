              Hello! My name is Muthukumar S, a passionate MERN Stack developer
              with hands-on experience in building full-stack web applications.
              I am skilled in front-end development using React, back-end
              development with Node.js and Express, and efficient database
              management with MongoDB. My strong foundation in JavaScript
              enables me to create dynamic and responsive web solutions.

              My previous experience includes working as an Automation Tester at
              Tech Mahindra, where I was involved in high-impact projects for
              major banking clients like Mizrahi Tefahot Bank in Israel and Ita√∫
              Unibanco in Brazil. During my tenure, I focused on ensuring the
              quality and reliability of T24 banking software by creating and
              maintaining automated test scripts, executing test cases, and
              reporting defects using tools like JIRA and Tool used for Automation 
              Testing - MAGiX.

              Working collaboratively within a team towards a shared objective
